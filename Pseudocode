Host Blacklisting

#Create a command line interface where you can enter a host FQDN to be blocked similar to DNS blackholing. 

#The script will use the hosts file to direct any requests to the specified host to 0.0.0.0. 

#If the specified entry already exists in the host file, the script must inform the user the host already exists and ask if the entry should be deleted or modified.
