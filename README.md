# GitHub-Python-Module
Final Assignment for the Python for Networking course.

This project is the culmination of my work in the Python for Networking course at Mohawk College. The goal was to create a module/package that can be imported into a user's system and access the HOSTS file. A command line interface is presented to the user so they can block a FQDN by updating the HOSTS table entry with the FQDN and sending it to a DNS blackhole (0.0.0.0). 

THe module is designed to function on any operating system, and incorporates error handling, File I/O, imported modules and command line arguments. If a user wants to use this module, they will need to have the following 3rd party modules imported in their python environment:

sys, os, platform, re, argparse, and from setuptools, setup and find_packages.

REFLECTION ##############################################################################################################################################################################I began my jouney into tech wanting to be a software developer. I quickly determined that coding wasn't for me while trying to find errant semicolons in my C programming however, and switched my focus to network engineering. Throughout my studies in networking, I found that theres no such thing as NOT programming in tech careers, so I redoubled my efforts to improve at coding. By the time I took this Python for Networking course, I was a lot more competent in programming, but still lacked confidence in my grasp at it. Throughout this course I developped my skills in python programming and learned so much about excellent networking related concepts and it really made me fall in love with programming. This course helped me come upt with the scripts I've used in other courses, and led me to explore and experiment with othre concepts and frameworks. In short, this course has taught me to program without fear, and to continue to grow as a programmer. 

This activity was challenging in that it prompted me to create a module that used different types of argparsing than the kind that I studied in the course, and I had to utilize error handling which is a technique that I'm still not entirely comfortable with, so there was a a fair amount of trial and error there. What I found most rewarding was the modules coming together and working after so much trial and error. 

Thank you Professor Lovie for providing me with the means and the knowledge to be a better programmer!
